##Minor problem in api

There is two minor problem in the api.

URL notification seems not accepting port number.
The system accepts this url, but event is never sent.
Is it a security or a bug ?

    http://1.1.1.1:111/api/create?token={token}&eventUrl={eventUrl}

A dead link is present in french text on the page "Tester les URLs de Notification".
The "Developer Event API" link is dead.
