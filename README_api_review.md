##Minor problem in api

There is two minors problems in the api.

URL notifications doesn't seem to accept port number configuration.
The system accepts this url, but event is never sent.
Is it a security or a bug ?

    http://1.1.1.1:8080/api/create?token={token}&eventUrl={eventUrl}

A dead link is present in french text on the page "Tester les URLs de Notification".
The "Developer Event API" link is dead.
